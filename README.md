## LibDriver PCA9685

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/pca9685/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications. Each LED output has its own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates
at a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 100 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.All outputs are set to the same PWM frequency.Each LED output can be off or on (no PWM control), or set at its individual PWM controller value. The LED output driver is programmed to be either open-drain with a 25 mA current sink capability at 5 V or totem pole with a 25 mA sink, 10 mA source capability at 5 V. The PCA9685 operates with a supply voltage range of 2.3 V to 5.5 V and the inputs and outputs are 5.5 V tolerant. LEDs can be directly connected to the LED output (up to 25 mA, 5.5 V) or controlled with external drivers and a minimum amount of discrete components for larger current or higher voltage LEDs.It can be used in RGB or RGBA LED drivers, LED status information, LED displays, LCD backlights, Keypad backlights for cellular phones or handheld devices and so on.

LibDriver PCA9685 is a full-featured driver of PCA9685 launched by LibDriver.PCA9685 provides pwm output and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/interface includes LibDriver PCA9685 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver PCA9685 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver PCA9685 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver PCA9685 offline document.

/datasheet includes PCA9685 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_pca9685_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i, times;
pca9685_address_t address;
pca9685_channel_t channel;

address = PCA9685_ADDRESS_A000000;
channel = PCA9685_CHANNEL_0;
times = 10;

res = pca9685_basic_init(address, 50);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 1; i < times + 1; i++)
{
    res = pca9685_basic_write(channel, 0.0f, 2.5f + (float)(i) / (float)(times) * 10.0f);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)pca9685_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    pca9685_interface_debug_print("pca9685: set channel %d %0.2f degrees.\n", channel, (float)(i) / (float)(times) * 180.0f);

    pca9685_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...

(void)pca9685_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
